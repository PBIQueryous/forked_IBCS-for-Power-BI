## Calcualtion items that generate IBCS-styled charts

svg-absolute-values.dax - generates SVG images for PY and AX column 

svg-absolute-variance.dax - generates SVG images for ΔPY column

svg-relative-variance.dax - generate SVG images for ΔPY% columns

See IBCS SVG 3-Tier Chart (with a calculation group).pbix example. SVG Absolute Values, SVG Absolute Variance, SVG Relative Variance calculation items in the IBCS CHARTS calculation group of the example report contain older version of the code. If you want to use the most recent version of the calculation items, you'll need to replace SVG Absolute Values, SVG Absolute Variance, and SVG Relative Variance calculation items in the IBCS CHARTS calculation group with the content of the .dax files provided here. You will also need to create any missing calculation items or measures referenced from the SVG* calculation items. I provide the materials as is, and it's up to you to make them work, but feel free to ask questions.

An updated version of the .pbix example that already includes the most recent version of the code will be pubslished in the following weeks.
